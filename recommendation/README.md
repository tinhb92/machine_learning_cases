Hadoop, Spark

**Key Qn: Provide shoppers quick access to best products in catalog/search results, making shopping easy**

Measure shoppers' interest through product engagement as a proxy: clicks, add-to-cart, checkouts, etc.

Predict future interest

Collect behavioral data: track and collect events on web (JavaScript), and app (Adjust), stream & process via Kafka, store in Hive tables

Product engagement metrics: average clicks, conversion rate

Better ranking improved conversion (3 - 8%)
Increase revenue per session by 5 - 20%

**Key Qn: Introduce new products**
demand: find what people need
supply: find product similar to top products, measure similarity with top products

Measure performance of new products across experimental groups using in-house tracker

Increased new product click-thru rate by 30-80%
Increased new product add-to-cart by 20-90%
Expected overall conversion to decrease - increased instead (though not statistically significant)

**Key Qn: How to Measure product quality**

content(title quality, richness of content), 

reviews (average rating, negative reviews), 

performance (click-thru rate, browsing time)

perfect order rate (i.e., not cancelled, not returned)

negative feedback (counterfeit, complaints)

seller metrics (timely shipped-rate, return rate)
