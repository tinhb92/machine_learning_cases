[2016 How Lazada ranks products](https://eugeneyan.com/2016/12/09/shared-about-my-work-in-lazada-at-strata-hadoop-singapore-2016)
Hadoop, Spark

Provide shoppers quick access to best products in catalog/search results, making shopping easy

Measure shoppers' interest through product engagement as a proxy: clicks, add-to-cart, checkouts, etc.

Predict future interest

Collect behavioral data: track and collect events on web (JavaScript), and app (Adjust), stream & process via Kafka, store in Hive tables

Product engagement metrics: average clicks, conversion rate

Better ranking improved conversion (3 - 8%)
Increase revenue per session by 5 - 20%

**Introduce new products**
demand: find what people need
supply: find product similar to top products, measure similarity with top products

Measure performance of new products across experimental groups using in-house tracker

Increased new product click-thru rate by 30-80%
Increased new product add-to-cart by 20-90%
Expected overall conversion to decrease - increased instead (though not statistically significant)

Measure product quality
content, reviews, performance (browsing time)
